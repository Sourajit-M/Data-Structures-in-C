Algorithm for add function:

1.Check if rear == MAX_SIZE - 1
    then print "Queue is full!"

2. Check if front == -1 && rear == -1
    set front=0 and rear = 0
3. Read an item 
4. Set rear  = rear +1
5. ar[rear] = elem


Algorithm for remove function:
1. Check if front == -1 && rear == -1
    print "Queue is empty!"
2. Else if front == rear
    print element at arr[front]
3. Set front = -1 and rear = -1
4. Else print element at arr[front]
5. set front = front +1
