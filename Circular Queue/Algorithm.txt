Algorithm for enqueue function:
1. Check if (rear+1)%N = front
    then print "Queue is full!"
2. read an item
3. else if front==-1 and rear ==-1
    then set front=0 and rear = 0
    arr[rear] = item
4. set rear = (rear+1)%N
5. arr[rear] = item


Algorithm for dequeue function:
1. Check if front == -1
    then print "Queue is empty!"
2. Check if front==rear
    then print elem at arr[front]
3. set front=-1 and rear = -1
4. Else set front = (front+1)%N
